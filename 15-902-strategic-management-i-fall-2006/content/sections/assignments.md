| 9 | Competitive Dynamics |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Ghemawat, Pankaj, and Bret Baird. "Leadership Online (A): Barnes & Noble vs. [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/)." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-798-063, May 26, 1998. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Corts, Kenneth S., and Jan W. Rivkin. "A Note on Microeconomics for Strategists." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-799-128. March 30, 1999. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Questions for Discussion{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} i. Based on your own experience of traditional bookselling and your exploration of online bookselling, compare willingness-to-pay for books supplied by these two business models. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} ii. Also compare the forecast long-run cost position of a successful online bookseller to Barnes & Noble's traditional business model. (Assume that Exhibits 4 and 7 in the case reflect average discounts of 10% off list price for Barnes & Noble's traditional bookstores and 25% off list for the online bookseller.) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} iii. Assess Barnes & Noble's response to the substitution threat from AMAZON®. How did AMAZON® respond in turn, and to what net effect? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} iv. Who will be the online leader? Will it ever make much money selling books (as opposed to selling stock)? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Please contrast the competitive positioning of a traditional, off-line, competitor like Barnes & Noble vs. an on-line channel like [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). With regard to question i., a customer willingness to pay for a product or a service is the maximum amount of money a customer is willing to part with in order to obtain a product or a service. The question is whether you find any significant difference in your willingness to pay for a book being acquired under these two different channels. In question ii. You might want to use the most recent data provided in Exhibit 4 (1996 for Barnes and Noble) and Exhibit 7 (F2001E for AMAZON®). Remember that Barnes & Noble provides 10% discount off list price, and AMAZON® provides 25%. The case is a good vehicle also to talk about the substitution threat Barnes & Noble and how it is responding against AMAZON®. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

| 11 | Corporate Strategy - The Core Concepts | {{< h 3 >}}Questions for Discussion{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} i. What are the central differences that exist between the development of a corporate and a business strategy? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} ii.

Do you like their strategic planning process and their executive compensation? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} (Johnson & Johnson (B): Hospital Services) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} iii. By establishing the Hospital Services Group (HSG), J&J seems to be taking an action against the fiber of its decentralization philosophy and culture.

How would you prevent possible conflicts between HSG and the J&J companies? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Although these cases on the surface are quite old, they address some very critical issues that have profound relevance in management regardless of time.

Case B deeply challenges the effectiveness of this management structure.
